user sign up:

what is the point of the divs wrapping fields on user sign up page?

password confirmation field is never considred invalid (even if blank or not matching; only password field is marked as invalid
password confirmation field is not cleared after invalid signup

failed sign up re-renders sign up page but
  1) the form has extra space the second time because of extra div wrapping invalid fields
  2) the url changes to /users

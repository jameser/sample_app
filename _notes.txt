user sign up:

what is the point of the divs wrapping fields on user sign up page?

password confirmation field is never considred invalid (even if blank or not matching; only password field is marked as invalid
password confirmation field is not cleared after invalid signup

failed sign up re-renders sign up page but
  1) the form has extra space the second time because of extra div wrapping invalid fields
  2) the url changes to /users
  
  
  spec_helper.rb:
  test_sign_in relies on 'controller', so it doesn't work in integration tests (which are under spec/requests)

  skipped the harder exercises.

Chapter 10
  pagination: will_paginate was a bit hard to get working (need 3.0pre2) so I also tried kaminari. kaminari seemed slower.
  exercise 10.4: how can we check that the url stuff is right in the destroy link?
